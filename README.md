# Yii2_Basic_Configuration
Configuring Yii2 Basic for my tastes. Setting up Pretty URLS, CDNs, i18n etc.

Having multiple websites I need to set up Yii2 Basic for the simple things like those shown above. Therefore I've created this repository mainly for my own use to configure Yii2 as for me. You are welcome to use it, make suggestions etc.
